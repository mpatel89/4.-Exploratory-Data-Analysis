# 4.-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Here will be stored scripts and figures for the projects in the John's Hopkins Data Science specialization 'Exploratory Data Analysis' Coursera course.


*8/17/15 I intended to put up files from the previous coureses in this specialization, but have not prepared them for or placed them on Github. That will be a 'to-do' thing in time. For now, I will be using this course to practice usage.

*8/22/15 I've now uploaded all R scripts and png files for generating the desired plots from the household_power_consumption.txt data file.
